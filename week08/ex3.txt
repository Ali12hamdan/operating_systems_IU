observations:
the program's memory usage increased by approximately 10MB every second.
the 'si' and 'so' fields in vmstat remained mostly at 0, indicating minimal swapping activity.
depending on the available free memory, there might be occasional non-zero values in 'si' and 'so',
    indicating some swapping activity.
as the program keeps allocating memory without freeing it, if the available
    memory becomes low, the system might start swapping more aggressively.
